# DL-Course
This is deep learning class lessons. 


## Installations And Build Image
1. Use google colab for all the above exercises. 
2. You can run them inside docker run following command to pull the docker image `docker pull ermaker/keras-jupyter`
3. Once the image is ready, run following command with tensorflow as backend `docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -e KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow ermaker/keras-jupyter`

# Data Augmentation Example
1. Various ways to augment the data
2. At times you need to curate the data, in one of the example we create image tampering data for training. 

# Tensorflow Example
1. Kalman filter implementation using tensorflow.
